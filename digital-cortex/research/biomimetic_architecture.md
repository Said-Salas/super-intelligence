##The Spiking Approach

##The Problem with Backpropagation
Standard AI uses Backpropagation. It requires a "God view" to calculate error for every neuron and adjust weights globally. Humans don't learn by getting slapped billions of times every time they are wrong. 

##Goal
Create a system that can see a pattern (e.g., "1 + 1") ONCE and wire a path to the answer ("2") immediately, due to the high energy of the coincident spikes.
