# Research Notes & Todo

## Key Questions
- [ ] How to train a neural net with minimal data? (Solved: STDP/Hebbian Learning)
- [ ] How to generalize better? (Hypothesis: Sparse distributed representations + Sleep/Consolidation)
- [ ] Neuroscience ideas to implement:
    - [x] Spiking Neurons (Izhikevich)
    - [x] Synaptic Plasticity (STDP)
    - [x] Neuromodulation (Dopamine gating)
    - [ ] Homeostasis (Self-regulation of firing rates)
    - [ ] Lateral Inhibition (Competition between neurons)
    - [ ] Sleep/Replay (Consolidating memories)

## Strategy
See [RESEARCH_STRATEGY.md](./RESEARCH_STRATEGY.md) for the philosophical framework.
