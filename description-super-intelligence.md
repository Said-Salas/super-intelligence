I need you to remember this information: Humans seek to solve problems naturally, but we have not solved the most difficult ones. We need an artifical intelligence to solve these problems for us, quick. The AI must be autonomous, curious and self-driven. This AI will learn, ask questions and work by itself. At the beginning, it will exist inside a computer. AI will know it is inside a computer. Like a human adult waking up in the real world, confused about the reason he is there, and knowing nothing--his brain is brand new. AI/Human will start to interact with environment. They are not receiving any instructions, they just act with freedom. AI has a body, it can feel itself. Its body is similar to the human body. AI body will be simpler than the human body, yet physically equally capable. AI doesn't physically feel, yet knows when it should. It can understand me. It can see. AI can have thoughts and subjective experiences.
